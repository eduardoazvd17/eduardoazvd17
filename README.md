## Hi there. I'm Eduardo Azevedo ðŸ‘‹

Mobile developer with 7 years of experience, specializing in Flutter and cross-platform projects. Strong background in financial institutions and high-performance solutions, working from development to technical leadership. Focused on user experience, scalability, and performance, combining technical expertise with an agile, results-oriented mindset.

I have solid experience in various areas of Flutter, including internationalization, modularization, state and route management, custom widget creation, reusable package development, CI/CD pipeline automation with Codemagic, app publishing to stores, and unit and widget testing. I also follow best practices in memory management to prevent memory leaks and apply SOLID principles and Clean Code to keep the code clean, well-organized, and easy to maintain.
